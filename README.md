# trackr

## If you like data and want to easily track your experience progression through the Dragon's Realms, you've come to the right place.  
  
When you begin to track a character you'll need to add a little about them; like name, guild, race, gender, etc., but these can all be edited later.  When updating a character, all you have to do is copy and paste your `EXP all` from DragonRealms (just what's between `SKILL:...Fraction` and your `TDPs`)!  Like so:
